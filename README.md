### <b>Dino</b>Vision

<b>Dino</b>Vision provides an interactive interface to explore 32,000 concept vectors. Each point represents a concept learned by sparse autoencoders. Click here to explore **[Launch DinoVision ‚Üí](https://fel-thomas.github.io/dinovision/)**


    üî¨ This project accompanies "Into the Rabbit Hull: From Task-Relevant Concepts in DINO to Minkowski Geometry" by Thomas Fel, Binxu Wang, and collaborators from the Kempner Institute at Harvard University.


---

## Features

- Interactive exploration of concept space with zoom and pan
- Click any point to view concept details and connections
- Search concepts by ID
- Adjustable visualization parameters (size, distance, opacity)
- Co-occurrence analysis showing related concepts
- Energy-based or uniform point sizing


## Usage

Navigate the visualization using mouse interactions:
- Zoom with mouse wheel
- Pan by clicking and dragging
- Hover over points to highlight them
- Click points to view details

Use the control panel to:
- Jump to specific concept IDs
- Adjust neighbor distance threshold
- Control point sizes and opacity
- Toggle energy-based sizing

## Technical Details

Built with Vue 3, D3.js, and Vuetify. Uses Canvas rendering for performance with large datasets. The visualization supports real-time interaction with 32,000+ data points.
The visualization expects a JSON file with the following structure:

```
{
  "umap_x": [float, ...],                    // UMAP x-coordinates for concepts
  "umap_y": [float, ...],                    // UMAP y-coordinates for concepts
  "umap_colors": [[r, g, b], ...],           // RGB color values (0-1 range)
  "umap_scale": [float, ...],                // Scale multipliers for point sizes
  "energy": [float, ...],                    // Activation energy values
  "is_dead": [0 or 1, ...],                  // Binary flags for active/inactive concepts
  "connections_idx": [[int, ...], ...],      // Connected concept IDs
  "connections_val": [[float, ...], ...],    // Connection strength values
  "nb_fire": [int, ...]                      // Activation frequency counts
}
```
